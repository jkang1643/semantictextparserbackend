# Full requirements for the complete pipeline (CPU-ONLY VERSION)
# Use this only if you need the full semantic segmentation capabilities
# IMPORTANT: This file enforces CPU-only dependencies - NO GPU support

# Core dependencies (same as requirements.txt)
nltk>=3.8.1
openai>=1.3.0
requests>=2.31.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0
pillow>=11.0.0

# Heavy ML dependencies (CPU-ONLY versions)
spacy>=3.7.0
sentence-transformers>=2.2.0
transformers>=4.35.0
scikit-learn>=1.3.0

# CRITICAL: PyTorch CPU-only installation
# DO NOT install torch from default PyPI - it may include CUDA
# Use the CPU-only index URL instead:
# pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# Note: After installing these, you'll need to download the spaCy model:
# python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
