John entered the forest. The trees loomed overhead.
The forest was alive with sounds. Strange markings appeared on the trees.
Suddenly, the temperature dropped. Ahead, he heard a sound.
A woman emerged, dressed in white. Her eyes glowed faintly.
She spoke softly. Then she added another line.
John felt a magical pull toward her.
